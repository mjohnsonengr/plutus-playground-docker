# Setup of Plutus Playground

## Prerequisites
* A Docker installation. For Windows, the WSL 2 based engine is recommended.
* Patience. Building and fetching all the sources will take on the order of 30 minutes an can vary widely with the quality of your internet connection and the machine you are using.
* Disk space: images built here are around 12 GB. 

## Running Plutus Playground
### Build the container
Building is required only once on your machine and has to be repeated only for the purpose of updating.
```
docker-compose build --build-arg PLUTUS_GIT_COMMIT=530cc134364ae186f39fb2b54239fb7c5e2986e9
```
The build argument is optional and defaults to the latest commit. (But beware of Docker caching!)

For the *Plutus Pioneer Program*, you should target a specific commit. Open the `cabal.project` file and look for `source-repository-package` with location [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus.git](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus.git). The specified tag, e.g., `530cc134364ae186f39fb2b54239fb7c5e2986e9` for week07, should be used as `PLUTUS_GIT_COMMIT`.

Note that the patch for the issue described [here](https://docs.plutus-community.com/docs/setup/WindowsWSL.html) in the section *Troubleshooting* is fragile and had to be adapted to [this upstream commit](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/commit/d9a840894576a9bec3274c8b0d349a93f6f86ac3). If you want to build week01 to week06, check out `ppp-week06` of this repository.

### Start the container
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Visit [https://localhost:8009/](https://localhost:8009/) and accept the security risk.

### Shutdown
The Playground can be stopped via:
```
docker-compose down
```


## Maintenance 
In case you forgot when you last ran `docker-compose build`, you can query the current version of Plutus Playground by
```
docker exec plutus-playground-docker_server_1 git rev-parse HEAD
```
The container name *plutus-playground-docker_server_1* (auto-generated by Docker compose) might require some adjustments.
